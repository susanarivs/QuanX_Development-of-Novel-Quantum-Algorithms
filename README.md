# QuanX_Development-of-Novel-Quantum-Algorithms

Objective: 
1.The primary goal is to demonstrate quantum computational advantage using an interactive protocol that employs trapdoor claw-free functions (TCFs). 

2.This approach links to Bellâ€™s inequality, reducing the need for complex cryptographic properties while maintaining efficient verifiability.
